Extension block (with arguments):

--- code, python, style = clean -----

for i in range(10):
    print(i)

--------------------------------------

Another example

--- math
x^2 + 3z \cdot \Lambda
---


Inline extension might look something like this
| math, x^2 + 3z |

/Italic/
*Bold*
_underlined_
+strikethrough+
Perhaps ^superscript^ as well, or maybe autoconvert stuff like this:
x^2 x_y but that creates problems/additional complexity if you would wish to include whitespace
in your superscripted text
