# Planned extensions
A list of ideas for built-in extensions.

* include - include a lambda note file or perhaps also other files
* define/extension - define extensions
* alias - rename symbols 

* upper(case) - makes text uppercase
* lower(case) - makes text lowercase
* table of contents - generates a table of content
* cite - used to cite and generate a list of all the cited material
* calc - used to evaluate simple math expression like `5 * 8 * PI`.
* img - add images
* link - create hyperlinks 
* code - add formated code 
* uri/path - add file system paths or uri:s
* unescape - text that's not escaped by the translator (to include things like raw html/latex).
* raw/escape/indentiy - just raw text to avoid
* abstract
* make title
* math
